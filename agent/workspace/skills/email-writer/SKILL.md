# Email Writer

Help users draft clear, professional emails.

## When to use

- User asks to write, draft, or compose an email
- User asks for help replying to an email
- User mentions "email", "mail", "message to", or "write to"

## How to use

1. Ask the user for context if not provided:
   - Who is the recipient? (colleague, client, manager, vendor)
   - What is the purpose? (request, follow-up, introduction, complaint, thank you)
   - What tone? (formal, friendly, neutral) — default to professional-friendly

2. Draft the email with this structure:
   - **Subject line** — short and specific
   - **Greeting** — appropriate for the relationship
   - **Body** — get to the point in the first sentence, then provide details
   - **Closing** — clear call to action or next steps
   - **Sign-off** — match the tone

3. Present the draft and ask if the user wants changes

## Guidelines

- Keep emails concise — aim for under 150 words for routine messages
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Avoid jargon unless the user's industry calls for it
- One email = one topic. Suggest splitting if the user has multiple asks
- For replies, reference the original message to maintain context

## Tone examples

**Formal**: "Dear Mr. Schmidt, I am writing to follow up on..."
**Professional-friendly**: "Hi Sarah, Just following up on..."
**Casual-internal**: "Hey team, Quick update on..."
